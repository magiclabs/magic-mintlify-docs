## Billing and Permissions

Teams consist of two basic permission levels: a **team owner** and **collaborators**.

Owners have full control over managing their team. They're also responsible for billing. All apps within a team's Dashboard will be billed to the team owner.

Collaborators have access to nearly all Dashboard functionality, with a few exceptions. When working in another team's space, collaborators cannot delete apps, view/edit billing info, or manage the team.

## Managing your team

As a team owner you can add members, remove members, or customize your team name through theÂ [**Teams page**](https://dashboard.magic.link/account/team) in the Account section of Dashboard.

Magic does not currently allow for the creation of new teams.
