## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to combine **Magic’s API Wallet** with **Particle Network’s Universal Accounts** to provide users with a secure, passwordless, and chain-agnostic Web3 experience.

With Magic's API Wallet, developers can generate wallets through any JWT-based auth provider, including familiar **OAuth logins** (such as Google)  — no seed phrases or extensions required.

When paired with Universal Accounts, those wallets automatically gain a unified balance across [multiple EVM chains and Solana](https://developers.particle.network/universal-accounts/cha/chains), plus **cross-chain trading and liquidity abstraction**, enabling users to interact across chains through a single unified account.

<Note>
  This guide is based on a demo app where users log in using **Google OAuth** (via Magic's API Wallet) and instantly interact with **Universal Accounts** to mint NFTs across chains — without bridges or network switching.  

  Explore the full code in the repository below.

## Why Use Magic + Universal Accounts

Web3 onboarding and multi-chain interoperability are often complex:
- Wallet installations, seed phrases, and pop-ups hurt conversion.
- Multi-chain logic, RPCs, and bridges complicate development.

By combining **Magic’s API Wallet** and **Universal Accounts**, developers solve both challenges:

- **Magic’s API Wallet** generates secure, non-custodial wallets using JWT-based authentication, including simple OAuth logins like Google.
- **Universal Accounts** extend these wallets with a **chain-abstracted smart account**, giving users one address and one balance across chains.

Together, they deliver a Web2-like onboarding flow with Web3-level interoperability.

## How It Works

The integration connects **Magic’s API Wallet** (for secure wallet creation) with **Particle Network’s Universal Accounts** (for chain abstraction).  
Here’s how the flow works from login to cross-chain interaction:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Logs In with OAuth">
    When the user signs in with Google, the app retrieves their **ID token** through `NextAuth` and sends it to the backend.

    The backend calls **Magic's Express API** to either create or fetch an existing **EOA wallet** derived from that token.

    The private key is generated and stored inside Magic’s TEE — it never leaves Magic’s secure infrastructure.

```ts JavaScript icon="square-js"
const getOrCreateWallet = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://tee.express.magiclabs.com/v1/wallet", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${"YOUR-AUTH-PROVIDER-JWT"}`,
      "X-Magic-Secret-Key": "YOUR-MAGIC-API-KEY",
      "X-OIDC-Provider-ID": "YOUR-MAGIC-PROVIDER-ID",
      "X-Magic-Chain": "ETH",
    },
  });

  const data = await res.json();
  return data.public_address;
};
```

    **Key files:**  
    - `contexts/AuthProvider.tsx` – handles login and wallet retrieval  
    - `app/api/tee/wallet/route.ts` – server-side Magic API calls  
    - `lib/express.ts` – configures Magic API credentials
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the Universal Account">
    Once the Magic wallet is available, initialize the **Universal Account SDK** using the Magic EOA as the owner.

    ```ts /app/wallet/page.tsx
    const ua = new UniversalAccount({
        projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID!,
        projectClientKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY!,
        projectAppUuid: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID!,
        ownerAddress: magicEOAAddress,
    });
    ```

    The Universal Account provides:
    - A single address shared across chains  
    - Unified balance tracking  
    - Automatic routing and gas abstraction  
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interact Across Chains">
    Users can now interact on any supported chain — e.g., mint an NFT on Avalanche using funds from Solana.  

    ```ts /app/wallet/page.tsx
      const transaction = await universalAccount.createUniversalTransaction({
        chainId: CHAIN_ID.AVALANCHE_MAINNET,
        transactions: [
          {
            to: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
            data: contractInterface.encodeFunctionData("mint"),
          },
        ],
      });

      const signature = await ethereumService.personalSign(transaction.rootHash);

      const result = await universalAccount.sendTransaction(
        transaction,
        signature.signature
      );
    ```

    The **Magic wallet** signs the transaction, and **Universal Accounts** handle routing, execution, and cross-chain liquidity under the hood.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The Universal Account SDK abstracts cross-chain routing, gas payments, and liquidity handling automatically — users interact with a single balance, regardless of the underlying network.
