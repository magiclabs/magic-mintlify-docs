## Overview

[Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) is a platform for cross-chain connected applications that unites assets and functionality from many blockchains. As a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected applications, Moonbeam powers dApps that can access users, assets, and services on any chain.

**As Moonbeam is EVM compatible**, you can follow the [Ethereum](/embedded-wallets/blockchains/ethereum/javascript)documentation to send your first transaction and utilize all other wallet features.

## Configure Moonbeam

### Moonbeam

```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
// Mainnet
const customNodeOptions = {
  rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.api.moonbeam.network',
  chainId: 1284
}

// Or connect to Moonbeam's Testnet
const customNodeOptions = {
  rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.api.moonbase.moonbeam.network',
  chainId: 1287
}

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY', { network: customNodeOptions });
```

## Moonriver

You can also connect to [Moonriver](https://docs.moonbeam.network/learn/platform/networks/moonriver/), which is currently live on [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), Polkadot's canary network. Moonriver is also EVM compatible so you can directly follow the [Ethereum installation](/embedded-wallets/blockchains/ethereum/javascript).

```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
const customNodeOptions = {
  rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.api.moonriver.moonbeam.network',
  chainId: 1285
}

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY', { network: customNodeOptions });
```

## Compatibility

- All `Auth`, `User` and most `Wallet` module methods\*
- All EVM Provider functionality to respond to supported [RPC methods](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/javascript#evm-rpc-methods)
