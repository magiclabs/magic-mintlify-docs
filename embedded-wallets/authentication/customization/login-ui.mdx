title: Login UI
---

## Overview

Magic's authentication can enable passwordless Web3 onboarding (no seed phrases) using multiple configurable methods.Â Each method either creates an account address for the user (non-custodial) or utilizes an existing account address. This is handled completely by Magic with out-of-the-box UI, with no lift from the integrating dApp.

### Compatibility

The Login UI is available via the following client-side SDKs:

- [Web](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/javascript)
- [React Native](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/react-native)
- [iOS](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/ios)
- [Android](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/android)

## Use Cases

- Allow your users to log in and/or sign up to your dApp using their preferred authentication method and gain access to their public wallet address on the network you are connected to.
- You can collect a signed token for wallet address verification and skip the need to explicitly request a personal signature which would prompt an additional screen.

## Authentication Methods

### Email One-Time Passcode

If a user chooses to authenticate through their email, they will receive a unique code to their email that is generated per attempt and the user will be required to enter it to authenticate. OTPs for email provide a simple and effective way to increase security and ensure the safety of user assets.

## Usage

### Login

```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
import { Magic } from "magic-sdk"

const magic = new Magic('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY', {
  network: "sepolia",
});

const accounts = await magic.wallet.connectWithUI();
```

The example above authenticates the user and connects to the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet. To connect to a different network, simply replace the configuration with another of [the 25+ chains supported by Magic](/embedded-wallets/blockchains/overview).
