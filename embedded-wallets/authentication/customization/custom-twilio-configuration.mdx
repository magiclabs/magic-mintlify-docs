We understand that every business has unique communication needs, including specific country restrictions, compliance requirements, and cost optimizations. With our Custom Twilio Configuration integration, you can connect your own Twilio account to our system and send SMS messages using your own Twilio credentials.

This guide walks you through the process of setting up and activating your Twilio integration in a few simple steps.

These authentication template formats are supported in Content Template Builder which supports basic authentication message, and optional expiry code and security advisory
