title: Email Logs
---

## Overview

Email logs allows developers to get visibility into the lifecycle of an email login. It provides granular information like when a login was initiated and when it was completed for email OTPs. This is useful for debugging customer support tickets and understanding basic insights.

To access it, navigate to the **Email Logs** tab in your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link).

<Note>
  This is a beta feature and only includes email based login events - additional
  methods like social logins are coming soon. For feedback, please reach out
  [here](https://magic-fortmatic.typeform.com/event-feedback).

Events in the table can take up to a minute to populate from the time the event has taken place. Events can be filtered by email address from the search bar at the top of the table.

Click on any event to reveal more information about the event, including the associated IP address and User Agent.
