## Overview

With the Enterprise MFA feature, Magic can integrate with any MFA provider. Please note that this feature is part of the Magic Enterprise tier, please [reach out](https://magic.link/contact) to learn more.

### Compatibility

Advanced MFA SDK methods are available via the following client-side SDKs:

- [Web](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/javascript)
- [React Native](/embedded-wallets/sdk/client-side/react-native)

## Usage

To enable Enterprise MFA, all that is required is for your third-party provider to be configured in our system and their issued JWT to be set in the custom authorization header via `magic.auth.setAuthorizationToken` prior to calling login:


```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
⁠const handleLogin = async () => {
   await magic.auth.setAuthorizationToken(jwt)
   await magic.auth.loginWithEmailOTP({ email });
};
```


Once you have added the `setAuthorizationToken` call into your login handler, Magic must enable the feature for your application. If you have users actively accessing your application, we recommend first testing this integration with a test application so that we can be sure to avoid any downtime when we turn on your production application.
