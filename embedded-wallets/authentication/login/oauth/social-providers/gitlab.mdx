</Frame>


13. When you click **Save application** you are provided with the application ID and the application secret which you can then use with your application that connects to GitLab
14. Return to your Magic Dashboard and input the **Application Id** and **Secret** for your GitLab OAuth app
15. In Magic Dashboard, click **“Save”** – Done!

### GitLab Setup (v2 extension)

* Follow above steps, but disregard Magic's **Redirect URI** in step 5
* In step 11, paste the **Redirect URI** you are passing in as the **redirectURI** argument to the **loginWithRedirect** method

```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
await magic.oauth2.loginWithRedirect({
  provider: 'gitlab',
  redirectURI: 'https://your-app.com/your/oauth/callback', // <== whitelist this with Gitlab
});
```
