## Usage

### Prerequisites

* You will need an [Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/) account
* You will need to have [created a primary **App ID**](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/DevPortalGuide/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs.html) for your Apple developer account
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK installed](/embedded-wallets/sdk/overview) into your web app
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK - OAuth Extension](/embedded-wallets/authentication/login/oauth/oauth-implementation) installed into your web app

### Apple Setup

After installing the OAuth extension, you can now enable Sign in with Apple for your Magic app. You'll need to collect credentials from Apple first, then configure Magic.

**Step 1: Collect Apple Credentials**

1.  Go to your [Apple developer dashboard](https://developer.apple.com/account)
2.  Navigate to [Membership details](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)
3.  Find and copy your **Team ID** (you'll need this later for Magic Dashboard)
4.  If you have not already created an Apple key, under **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** select **Keys**
5.  On the Keys page, click the blue plus button to create a new key. Make sure to enable **Sign in with Apple**.

7.  In Apple's dashboard, navigate to **Identifiers** under [Certificates, IDs, & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)
8.  Add a new [Services ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/serviceId) for your Magic authentication connection. Click **Continue**, then click **Register**

10. In the configuration modal, whitelist your app's domain in **Domains & Subdomains**, and add your **Redirect URI** in the **Return URLs** field:
    
    Add the **Redirect URI** you are passing as the **redirectURI** argument to the **loginWithRedirect** method:
    
    ```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
    await magic.oauth2.loginWithRedirect({
      provider: 'apple',
      redirectURI: 'https://your-app.com/your/oauth/callback', // whitelist this with Apple
    });
    ```

11. Click **Continue**, then **Save** to save your Services ID configuration
