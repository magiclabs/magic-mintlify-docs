## Authentication

Core API requires authentication using your Magic secret key:

<ParamField header="x-magic-secret-key" type="string" required>
Your Magic secret key for service authentication. Format: `sk_live_XXXXXXXX`
</ParamField>

<Warning>
This secret key should be treated as extremely sensitive, as it would allow anyone to trigger the creation of a wallet and return the access and recovery key.
</Warning>
