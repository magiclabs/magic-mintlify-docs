## Prerequisites

Before using Core API, you'll need to:

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Magic Account">
Visit the [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link/) and sign up for a Magic developer account.
</Step>

<Step title="Create an Application">
In your dashboard, create a new application and obtain your API keys.
</Step>

<Step title="Use your Secret Key">
Your `Secret Key` will be used for all calls to the Core API.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

Core API requires authentication using your Magic secret key:

<ParamField header="x-magic-secret-key" type="string" required>
Your Magic secret key for service authentication. Format: `sk_live_XXXXXXXX`
</ParamField>

<Warning>
This secret key should be treated as extremely sensitive, as it would allow anyone to trigger the creation of a wallet and return the access and recovery key.
</Warning>
