  <Accordion title="Why is Magic Involved?">
You might wonder what Magic is and why it’s needed to connect to a website or app you’re visiting. Can’t this be done directly through the website or app?

Magic provides websites and apps with technology that enables you to set up a virtual wallet, which is a unique account that exists on a highly secure database (i.e., a blockchain).

In order to give you full control over your digital collectibles and allow you to securely store them, brands need to use this database.

Due to the technical complexity, most websites and apps do not provide a way for users to access this database. This is why they use Magic to help you connect your email, phone number or social login to a new virtual wallet, allowing you to instantly sign in to a website or app that requires a wallet without any hassle.

**Neither Magic nor any service provider or user can access or control your wallet. Once your wallet is setup, only you have permission to manage the assets within it.**

  <Accordion title="What is a wallet?">
Wallets are used to interact with blockchains. Each wallet has a unique address and can contain things like cryptocurrencies or digital collectibles (NFTs). A single wallet can be used across different blockchain networks, but **wallet assets stay tied to a specific blockchain**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Magic Wallet work?">
Magic Wallet is a web-based wallet that **does not require browser extensions, secret phrases, or downloads**. It’s interoperable, meaning you can bring your wallet over to any site that supports it, but [wallet.magic.link](https://wallet.magic.link/) is your go-to destination to access your wallet at any time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Magic Wallet secure?">
