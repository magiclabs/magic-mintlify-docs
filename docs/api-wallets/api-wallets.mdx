## Express API

TEE Express is a service that simplifies wallet management for developers. Unlike traditional wallet solutions that require complex key management, TEE Express handles all key management internally, providing a streamlined API for wallet operations.

TEE Express leverages secure enclave technology to ensure that private keys never leave the secure environment. All wallet operations, including creation, signing, and key management, are performed within a trusted execution environment (TEE). This provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining the simplicity of a REST API.

The service supports Ethereum wallets and provides endpoints for wallet creation, transaction signing, and message signing. All operations are authenticated using JWT tokens passed in the Authorization header, ensuring secure access to user wallets.

## Security Features

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

TEE Express provides enterprise-grade security through:

- **Secure Enclaves**: Private keys never leave the secure environment
- **Hardware Security**: All cryptographic operations performed in trusted hardware
- **Isolated Execution**: Wallet operations run in completely isolated environments
- **Tamper Resistance**: Protection against both software and hardware attacks

### Authentication Layers

Multiple authentication layers ensure secure access:

1. **JWT Bearer Token**: User-specific authentication
2. **API Key/Secret Key**: Magic service authentication and authorization  
3. **OIDC Provider ID**: Application-specific identification

### Key Management

- **No Key Exposure**: Private keys are generated and stored entirely within the TEE
- **Automatic Key Derivation**: Keys are derived deterministically for consistency
- **Secure Operations**: All signing operations happen within the secure enclave
