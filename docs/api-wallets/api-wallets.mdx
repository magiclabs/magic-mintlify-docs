## Express API

API Wallets Express is a service that simplifies wallet management for developers. Unlike traditional wallet solutions that require complex key management, API Wallets Express handles all key management internally, providing a streamlined API for wallet operations.

API Wallets Express leverages secure enclave technology to ensure that private keys never leave the secure environment. All wallet operations, including creation, signing, and key management, are performed within a trusted execution environment (TEE). This provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining the simplicity of a REST API.

The service supports Ethereum wallets and provides endpoints for wallet creation, transaction signing, and message signing. All operations are authenticated using JWT tokens passed in the Authorization header, ensuring secure access to user wallets.

## Core API

API Wallets Core is a server-side solution that can be seamlessly incorporated into any tech stack. This API gives developers the freedom to choose how key management is handled, without having to rebuild that infrastructure.

This un-opinionated server-side solution to key management has no client-side dependencies like iframes or local sessions, which helps developers build smooth onchain user experiences.

API Wallets Core leverages the security of AWS Nitro Trusted Execution Environment to provide enhanced security for all key operations, like wallet generation and signing transaction payloads.

## Security Features

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

TEE Express provides enterprise-grade security through:

- **Secure Enclaves**: Private keys never leave the secure environment
- **Hardware Security**: All cryptographic operations performed in trusted hardware
- **Isolated Execution**: Wallet operations run in completely isolated environments
- **Tamper Resistance**: Protection against both software and hardware attacks

### Authentication Layers

Multiple authentication layers ensure secure access:

1. **JWT Bearer Token**: User-specific authentication
2. **API Key/Secret Key**: Magic service authentication and authorization  
3. **OIDC Provider ID**: Application-specific identification

### Key Management

- **No Key Exposure**: Private keys are generated and stored entirely within the TEE
- **Automatic Key Derivation**: Keys are derived deterministically for consistency
- **Secure Operations**: All signing operations happen within the secure enclave
