## Authentication

Express API requires multiple authentication headers for secure access:

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
Bearer token (JWT) for user authentication. Format: `Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN`
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Magic-API-Key" type="string">
Your Magic API key for service authentication.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-Magic-Secret-Key" type="string">
Alternative to API key - your Magic secret key for service authentication.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="X-OIDC-Provider-ID" type="string" required>
The OIDC provider ID for your application.
</ParamField>

<Warning>
You must provide either `X-Magic-API-Key` or `X-Magic-Secret-Key` along with the other required headers.
</Warning>

<Tip>
The JWT token should contain user identification information that Magic can use to associate wallets with specific users. Ensure your OIDC provider is configured to include necessary user claims.
