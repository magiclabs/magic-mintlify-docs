## Usage

### Prerequisites


<Note>
Magic SDK offers two OAuth extensions: [v1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magic-ext/oauth) and [v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magic-ext/oauth2). For web applications, it is recommended to use v2, while v1 should be used for mobile applications.
</Note>
* You will need an [Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/) account
* You will need to have [created a primary **App ID**](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/DevPortalGuide/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs/CreatingandConfiguringAppIDs.html) for your Apple developer account
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK installed](/docs/embedded-wallet/api/overview) into your web app
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK - OAuth Extension](/docs/embedded-wallet/authentication/login/social-logins/oauth-implementation) installed into your web app

### Apple Setup (v1 extension)

1.  Go to your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link/login)
2.  Select the Magic app for which you’d like to enable Sign in with Apple, or create a new app
3.  Navigate to **Social Login** from the sidebar
4.  Click the toggle for **Apple**. Looks like we'll need to collect a few important details from Apple first: a **Services ID**, **Key ID**, **Team ID**, and **Private Key**
5.  Open a new tab, go to your [Apple developer dashboard](https://developer.apple.com/account)
6.  Navigate to [**Membership details**](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership)
7.  Find your **Team ID**. Copy/paste this to the setup form on Magic Dashboard
8.  In Apple's dashboard, navigate to **Identifiers** under [**Certificates, IDs, & Profiles**](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)
9.  Add a new [**Services ID**](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/serviceId) for your Magic authentication connection. The **identifier** you select here should be added to the setup form on Magic Dashboard as your **Services ID**. Click **Continue**, then click **Register**.
10.

    You'll be returned to a list of Services IDs you've registered, including your new one for Magic authentication. Click your newly created Services ID to enable it for **Sign in with Apple**. Then, click **Configure**.

11. A modal will show, allowing you to connect your Services ID to specific internet domains. In **Domains & Subdomains**, enter `**auth.magic.link**`. In **Return URLs**, you'll paste the **Redirect URI** listed on Magic Dashboard for your Apple Social Login connection. Once you've entered the correct information, you can save your **Services ID** by clicking **Continue**, then **Save**.
12.

    Return to Magic Dashboard, you should have **Team ID** and **Services ID** populated by this step. Now you can paste your **Key ID** as well. Finally, you'll need to paste the contents of the **Private Key** file you downloaded from Apple's dashboard Click **“Save”** – Done!

### Apple Setup (v2 extension)

* In step 11, whitelist your app's domain in **Domains & Subdomains**, and paste the **Redirect URI** you will pass in as the **redirectURI** argument to the **loginWithRedirect** method


```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
await magic.oauth2.loginWithRedirect({
 provider:  'apple',
 redirectURI:  'https://your-app.com/your/oauth/callback',  // <== whitelist this with Apple
});
```
