## Usage

### Prerequisites

<Note>
Magic SDK offers two OAuth extensions: [v1](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magic-ext/oauth) and [v2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magic-ext/oauth2). For web applications, it is recommended to use v2, while v1 should be used for mobile applications.
</Note>
* You will need a [Discord](https://discord.com/developers) account
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK installed](/docs/embedded-wallet/api/overview) into your web app
* You will need to have the [Magic SDK - OAuth Extension](/docs/embedded-wallet/authentication/login/social-logins/oauth-implementation) installed into your web app

### Discord Setup (v1 extension)

After installing the OAuth extension, you can now enable GitHub Login for your Magic app:

1.  Create a Discord [API application](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2.  Go to your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link/login)
3.  Select the Magic app for which you’d like to enable Discord Login, or create a new app
4.  Navigate to **Social Login** from the sidebar
5.  Click the toggle for **Discord**
6.  Copy the **Redirect URI** field from your Magic Dashboard
7.  Return to your Discord developer Dashboard, navigate to **OAuth2** from the sidebar, and paste the **Redirect URI** you obtained from your Magic Dashboard into the **"Redirect URI"** field. Don't forget to save your changes!

9.  Return to your Magic Dashboard and input the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your Discord OAuth app
10. In Magic Dashboard, click **“Save”** – Done!

### Discord Setup (v2 extension)

* Follow above steps, but disregard Magic's **Redirect URI** in step 6
* In step 7, paste the **Redirect URI** you are passing in as the **redirectURI** argument to the **loginWithRedirect** method

```javascript JavaScript icon="square-js"
await magic.oauth2.loginWithRedirect({
  provider:  'discord',
  redirectURI: 'https://your-app.com/your/oauth/callback',  // <== whitelist this with Discord
});
```
