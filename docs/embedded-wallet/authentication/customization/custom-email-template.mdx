## Overview

Magic's Custom Email Template feature allows you to fully tailor your app's login email using your own custom HTML. With this feature, developers can customize emails that use one-time passcodes or magic links.

**Note: Custom email templates require using your own existing email provider.** You can register a custom email provider through the Settings page in the Magic dashboard. This feature is available to developers on our Growth or Enterprise Plans - you can head [here](https://magic.link/pricing) to learn more.

### Configuration

Custom Email Templates can be figured in the [Magic dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link). Navigate to **Customization**, then **Email** to create and edit templates.

The following is a list of variables that can be used when creating a custom email template in Magic. From the dashboard editor, variables must be wrapped in `{{}}` in order to be resolved to their value. For example, to use the one-time passcode, insert `{{otp}}` into the template.

- `otp`: One-time passcode. Example: 412320
- `magic_link`: Magic link URL. Example: “https://auth.magic.link/confirm?tlt=eyJh…”
- `app.name`: The name of the application. Example: “My test app”
- `user.email`: Email address of the user receiving the login email. Example: joe@magic.link
- `template.locale`: Language of the user receiving the login email. Example: en_US
- `login.device.browser`: Browser of the user receiving the login email. Example: Chrome
- `login.device.os`: Operating system of the user receiving the login email. Example: MacOS
- `login.timestamp`: Timestamp of when email was requested

## Usage

> ⁠**ℹ️** **This feature is supported in Magic SDK 21.1.0 and above.**

### Testing

Once a template has been created, you can use the **Send Test** button at the bottom of the customization page to send an email to the account that is currently logged in. Note that test emails will contain placeholder values for `otp` and `magic_link`.

You can also view a live preview of your email in a separate browser window by selecting **Preview** from the overflow menu at the top of the page.

Testing the full end-to-end user experience will require publishing your template to a live development environment. To ensure the best results, we recommend utilizing a dedicated email testing service such as [Litmus](https://www.litmus.com/).

### Production

In order to use the newly created template, the `template name` must be passed in as an argument into the login method.
