## Overview

[Binance Smart Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bnb-smart-chain) is a Layer 1 blockchain network that's compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), specifically designed to revolutionize the world of sports. Through the Magic SDK, users can easily create wallets and engage with Binance Smart Chain, enabling teams, fans, and developers to craft Web3 products and experiences that unite fans and brands like never before.

**As Binance Smart Chain is EVM compatible**, you can follow the [Ethereum](/docs/embedded-wallet/blockchains/featured-chains/ethereum/javascript) documentation to send your first transaction and utilize all other features.
