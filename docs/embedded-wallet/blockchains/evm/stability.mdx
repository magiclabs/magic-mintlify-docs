title: Stability
description: "Stability's blockchain is a tokenless, open-source, decentralized, public, and highly scalable platform. It eliminates transaction fees by using API keys instead of tokens. "
---

## Overview

The open-source nature of Stability allows for transparency and security audits. Decentralization is achieved through a trusted network consensus, ensuring no single entity controls the network. Its public accessibility invites widespread participation, and it supports up to 10,000 transactions per second, addressing scalability challenges.

For more details, you can visit the [Stability Protocol documentation](https://docs.stabilityprotocol.com/how_stability_works/intro_to_stability).

**As Stability is EVM compatible**, you can follow the [Ethereum](/docs/embedded-wallet/blockchains/featured-chains/ethereum/javascript) documentation to send your first transaction and utilize all other wallet features.

## Configure Stability

Ensure you have installed the Magic SDK and have access to your API key, follow the [quickstart](/docs/embedded-wallet/quickstart/overview) to get started. You can use Magic's network aliases to connect to either testnet or mainnet on Base.

<CodeGroup>
```js Testnet icon="square-js"
// Setting network to point to Stability testnet
const magic = new Magic('MAGIC_API_KEY', {
  network: {
    rpcUrl: 'https://free.testnet.stabilityprotocol.com/zgt/<STABILITY_API_KEY>',
    chainId: 20180427,
  }
});
```
```js Mainnet icon="square-js"
// Setting network to point to Stability mainnet
const magic = new Magic('MAGIC_API_KEY', {
  network: {
    rpcUrl: 'https://gtn.stabilityprotocol.com/zgt/<STABILITY_API_KEY>',
    chainId: 101010,
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Transactions

In order to perform transactions on Stability, developers need to sign up for an API key using [Stability's Account Portal](https://account.stabilityprotocol.com/). For a quickstart tutorial on Stability, view their tutorial on their documentation at [https://docs.stble.io/developers/getting_started](https://docs.stble.io/developers/getting_started).

The testnet public RPC will allow a few transactions to go through, but most clients will need an API key. The mainnet public RPC will not allow any transactions to go through unless an API key is concatenated to it.

## Compatibility

- All `Auth`, `User` and `Wallet` module methods
- All EVM Provider functionality to respond to supported [RPC methods](/docs/embedded-wallet/api/client-side-sdks/web#evm-rpc-methods)
