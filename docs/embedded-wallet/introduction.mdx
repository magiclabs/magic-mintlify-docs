## What are Embedded Wallets?

Magic's Embedded Wallets are non-custodial wallets that are seamlessly integrated directly into your application. When users authenticate through any of Magic's passwordless login methods, they're automatically provisioned with a secure wallet that enables seamless Web3 onboarding experiences.

### Key Benefits

- **Non-custodial security**: Users maintain full control over their private keys through Magic's patented Delegated Key Management System (DKMS)
- **Passwordless authentication**: No passwords to manage - users authenticate via email OTP, SMS, social logins, and more
- **Multi-chain support**: Works with 25+ blockchain networks including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Bitcoin, and more
- **Instant onboarding**: Users get a wallet immediately upon authentication, eliminating complex setup processes

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: User logs in using any supported method (email, sms, social, etc.)
2. **Automatic Wallet Creation**: Magic instantly creates a non-custodial wallet for the user
