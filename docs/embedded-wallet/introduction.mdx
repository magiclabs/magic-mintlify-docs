## What are Embedded Wallets?

Magic's Embedded Wallets are non-custodial wallets that are seamlessly integrated directly into your application. When users authenticate through any of Magic's passwordless login methods, they're automatically provisioned with a secure wallet that enables seamless Web3 onboarding experiences.
