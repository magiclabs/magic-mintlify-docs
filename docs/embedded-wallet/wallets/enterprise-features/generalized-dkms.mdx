## Overview

It leverages Magic’s patented Delegated Key Management System to encrypt **any data** in the secure iframe using the user's private key. From there, developers can store the data via any mechanism - Magic does not store the data. The data always remains private and secure - developers and Magic cannot manipulate the data.

### Compatibility

G-DKMS SDK methods are available via the [Web client-side SDK](/docs/embedded-wallet/api/client-side-sdks/web).

## Usage

To leverage G-DKMS a developer can call the following two methods after a user has been logged in:

```javascript javascript
const cipherText = await magic.gdkms.encryptWithPrivateKey("hello world");
// <- "U2FsdGVkX19CZ2XlS839ihS7J9cXPw8cTzCVabagdGw="

const message = await magic.gdkms.decryptWithPrivateKey(
  "U2FsdGVkX19CZ2XlS839ihS7J9cXPw8cTzCVabagdGw="
);
// <- "hello world"
```
