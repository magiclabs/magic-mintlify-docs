title: Content Security Policy
description: "The [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) (CSP) of a browser dictates what resources can load."

## Overview

Magic maintains a predefined list of RPC URLs in the CSP. You can find these RPC URLs in [the page relevant to your chosen blockchain](/docs/embedded-wallet/blockchains/overview). You can update the policy on the Settings page in the [Magic Dashboard](http://dashboard.magic.link) with a custom URL.

## Use cases

- Use the [connect-src directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src) to allow specific URLs, such as a custom RPC URL to send transactions to your node

## Usage

When connecting to a custom RPC node, ensure that the URL you use in your code has been added to the CSP in your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link).

```javascript JavaScript
const customNodeOptions = {
  rpcUrl: 'https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xyz', // Your own node URL
  chainId: 1011, // Your own node's chainId
};

// Setting network to localhost blockchain
const magic = new Magic('YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY', {
  network: customNodeOptions,
});
```
