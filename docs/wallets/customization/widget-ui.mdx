To use fiat on-ramp from the various providers for Dedicated Wallet apps, **please contact us to complete the mandatory KYB process with the payment provider**. Once approved, ensure this toggle is enabled in your developer dashboard via the ‘Widget UI’ tab.

## Configuration

The developer dashboard’s "Widget UI" tab contains configurations that allow you to customize the wallet UI with some optional toggles:

* With the “NFT” toggle, you can hide or show collectibles to your users. This setting will apply across all the UI methods.
* With transaction signing on, any supported EVM RPC methods that require a signature will trigger a secure end-user confirmation prompt.

**Note:** Once you enable or disable a toggle, the client will need to be reloaded / refreshed in order to see the changes.

You can also customize the [branding and theming of the UI](/docs/wallets/customization/brand-and-theme) through the developer dashboard.
