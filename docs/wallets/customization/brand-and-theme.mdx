## Overview

When Magic's wallet widget is shown, you have the ability to configure some UI options to reflect your brand. The level of customization depends on the pricing tier you have selected. During the trial phase, you will have access to all functionality for this feature.

**Included with all plans:**

- Change the default Magic branding to a custom logo and app name

  <Frame>

## Usage

You can customize the logo and colors of the Magic link email, confirmation screen, and pending modal on the **Branding** tab in the [**Magic Dashboard**](https://dashboard.magic.link/)**:**

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/Branding-usage.webp" alt="" />

## Notes

- To provide a consistent end-to-end user experience, logos are automatically masked to be circular. We recommend using a square image with adequate safe space. Only PNG, JPG, JPEG files and logos up to 512kb are supported.
