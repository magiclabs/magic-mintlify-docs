### Compatibility

<Note>
**NOTE**

This feature can only be utilized with [Dedicated Wallet](/docs/wallets/wallet-types#dedicated-wallet) apps. See our [FAQ's](/docs/home/faq/dedicated-wallet#questions-around-sms) on supported country codes.

</Note>
SMS Login SDK methods are available on all [client-side SDKs](/docs/api/overview#client-side-sdk).

## Use Cases

* Log in and create wallets for end users with a one-time code sent by SMS to their phone number.

## Usage

You can use SMS login by creating a project with our [CLI tool](/docs/home/quickstart) and picking 'SMS' when prompted. Alternatively, you can directly integrate it into your existing projects using the sample below. **Refer to the** [**API documentation**](/docs/api/overview) **for information on how to install and initialize Magic for your existing project.**

Once you've created a Magic instance, log users in using `loginWithSMS`. Once logged in, you will receive a DID token that can be used with our [Admin SDK](/docs/api/server-side-sdks/node#token-module) to verify the user's information and wallet address on the backend. You can also retrieve the user's wallet address and email using the `user` module's [`getInfo`](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/web#getinfo) function for Web/React Native and `getMetadata` for iOS, Android and Flutter.

```Javascript Javascript

// Assumes you've initialized a `Magic` instance with a Dedicated Wallet API Key
const login = async (phoneNumber) => {
     try {
        const did = await magic.auth.loginWithSMS({
          phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
        });
        console.log(`DID Token: ${did}`);

        const userInfo = await magic.user.getInfo();
        console.log(`UserInfo: ${userInfo}`);

⁠        // Handle user information as needed
     } catch {
       // Handle errors as required
     }
}
```
