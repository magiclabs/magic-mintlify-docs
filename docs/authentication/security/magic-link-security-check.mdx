The Magic Link Security Check feature only applies to Dedicated Wallets; Universal Wallets do not support magic links as a login method. Dedicated Wallets are by default opted out, but we do recommend that you enable it to enhance wallet security.

To enable Magic Link Security Checks in the user wallets of your app:

1.  Go to the [Magic Dashboard](http://dashboard.magic.link/) and sign into your developer account
2.  Go to your Dedicated Wallet app for which you would like to enable this feature
3.  Go to “Settings” on the left navigation bar, scroll down to the “Magic Link Security Check” section, and click "Edit" in the top right corner
4.  Toggle on “Enable security check on login” and click “Save”
