## Overview

This feature requires two prerequisites:

1.  The primary login factor is an email (this includes `loginWithMagicLink` and `loginWithEmailOTP` implementations)

2.  The user can prove ownership of a phone number, which will be used as the recovery factor

### Compatibility

Account recovery methods are available on the following client-side SDKs:

- [Web](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/web)
- [React Native](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/react-native)
- [iOS](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/ios)
- [Android](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/android)

## Usage

## Enabling Account Recovery

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/01_enable-recovery-method.webp" alt="" />
</Frame>

To enable SMS recovery for your users:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Javascript">```json ⁠magic.user.showSettings(); ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

This will display a settings modal where users will be able to add a recovery factor.

Additionally, Magic supports a deep linking flow where you can send users straight to adding a recovery factor. [The flow can also be whitelabeled](/docs/api/client-side-sdks/web#show-settings-show-ui-false-page-recovery):

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Javascript">
```json
magic.user.showSettings({ page:'recovery'  });
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Recover Account

Once a recovery factor is a set up, a user can recover their account. To enable this, the developer should call the following:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Javascript">
```json
magic.user.recoverAccount({ email: email })
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
It’s important to note that updating the recovery factor is a security sensitive operation so users will first be prompted to demonstrate account ownership by authenticating their email via a one-time-passcode before they are able to add a recovery phone number.
