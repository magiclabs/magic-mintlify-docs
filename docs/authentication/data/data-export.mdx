## Overview

Data for which users are using your application can be found in the **Users** tab in your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link/). Basic attributes are provided per user, including their email address, when they signed up and when they last logged in.

Customers who are Startup and Growth subscribers will also have the ability to export data into a CSV format. This is available via the `Export CSV` button in the top right hand corner of the page.
