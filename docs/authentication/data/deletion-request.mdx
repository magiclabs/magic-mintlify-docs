## Overview

The **Deletion Request API** enables developers to delete users' information in compliance with GDPR. This API is designed for applications that require bulk deletion operations and supports authentication using the application's secret key.

## Usage

### Request

The bulk deletion endpoint supports deleting multiple user accounts in a single API call. To use this endpoint, send a POST request to the following URL with a payload that includes the list of email addresses associated with the accounts you want to delete.

```json
curl --location 'https://api.magic.link/v1/api/auth_user/deletion_request' \
--header 'X-Magic-Secret-Key: <SECRET_KEY>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "emails": ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
}'
```

### [#Response](#response)

#### Success

Upon successful request processing, the API returns a response with lists of processed and unprocessed emails.

- `processed`: An array of emails that have been queued for deletion.
- `unprocessed`: An array of emails that were not found and hence not processed.

```json
{
  "processed": ["user1@example.com"],
  "unprocessed": ["user2@example.com"]
}
```

#### Failure

In the event of an error, the API will return an error code and message.

- `400 Bad Request`: Your request is invalid. This often occurs due to missing the `emails` field in the request body.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Your authorization token is missing or invalid.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: You have hit the rate limit for deletion requests. Please wait before sending more requests.
